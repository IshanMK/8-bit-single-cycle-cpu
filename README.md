# CO224-Computer-Architecture

simple 8-bit single-cycle processor which includes an 
ALU, a register file and control logic, using Verilog HDL


A single cycle processor was built using verilog- behavioural modeling. The basic functionalities implemented include an instruction fetch unit, a decoder, a register file, a control unit, an arithmetic and logic unit, and a data and instruction memory unit.

In addition to the basic functionalities of a CPU, a memory hierarchy too was built using cache levels. CPU organization too was considered when finalizing the design and functioning of the CPU.
